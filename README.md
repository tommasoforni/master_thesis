# Development of two crossed actively stabilized Fabry-Perot cavities for dual color X-ray generation through Compton scattering for the MariX project

### Abstract:

The purpose of the thesis is the realization of two high Finesse feedback-stabilized Fabry-Perot cavities to be used in the MariX project. Resonant cavities are needed in the inverse Compton scattering source of MariX to reach the optical power requested by the scattering process. The cavities will be placed at different angles in respect to the electron beam in order to generate X-rays at two different energies. The switch between the two colors is possible thanks to moving mirrors that can translate the focus of the cavities away or towards the electron beam while keeping the cavities actively stabilized and coupled with the laser oscillator. The applications of this dual color system are in the medical imaging field, in particular in K-Edge subtraction imaging, and in pump-probe experiments. The thesis consists in an introduction to the MariX project, a theoretical chapter on Compton scattering and optical cavity theory and then a presentation of the experimental results obtained. These include: measurements on the movement of the cavities focus, the cavity power spectral density noise and finesse, the oscillator pulse lenght, the piezoelectric-driven mirrors movements.
